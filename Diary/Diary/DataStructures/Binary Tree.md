A binary tree is similar to a [[Linked List]] except each node can have up to 2 children instead, therefore creating a "tree" like form. Some basic operation of a binary tree would include adding data, removing data, searching for a node, and traversing the tree. Some more advanced operations are getting the height of the tree, get total size of a tree, find the level of a node.

## Notes when researching
#### [Binary Tree Basics - Professor Hank Stalica](https://youtube.com/watch?v=5p5rOZh03pg)
- Binary trees are a type of graph
- Members of a tree are called nodes
	- Nodes can have 0, 1, 2 children
	- Node with no children is called a leaf node
	- Root node has no parents, can only have 1 root node for a tree
- A Path is a series of nodes from a parent to a child node
- Height of a tree is length of the longest path from a root node to a leaf
- A subtree is a collection of nodes that descend from a particular node (not necessarily the root node) all the way down
- All added nodes are going to be leaves
- Levels = height of tree
	- Root node always starts at level 0
