A stack is a First-In-First-Out data structure which is best described by in my head as a stack of plates. The top ones get cleaned first even though the bottom ones were in the stack first. 

It's basically an array which only allows users to push onto the stack and pop off a stack, as well as some basic viewing functionality maybe? Like length of stack.
